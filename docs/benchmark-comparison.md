# Benchmark Comparison: terlik.js vs Alternatives

Automated, reproducible comparison of terlik.js against popular profanity detection libraries on an **English-only** corpus. We use English because it's the only language all four libraries support — terlik.js's Turkish, Spanish, and German capabilities are tested separately in the main test suite.

> **Transparency note:** This benchmark is maintained by the terlik.js team. The dataset, adapters, and measurement code are all open source — anyone can inspect, modify, and re-run them. We encourage you to verify these results on your own hardware. See [Run It Yourself](#run-it-yourself) below.

## TL;DR — The Scorecard

| Metric | terlik.js | obscenity | bad-words | allprofanity |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Overall F1** | **100.0%** | 81.7% | 66.1% | 59.7% |
| **False Positives** | **0** | 3 | 0 | 0 |
| **False Negatives** | **0** | 48 | 82 | 93 |
| **Total Errors** | **0 / 290** | 51 / 290 | 82 / 290 | 93 / 290 |
| **Detection Speed** | 68K ops/sec | **72K ops/sec** | 2.8K ops/sec | 45K ops/sec |
| **Cleaning Speed** | **71K ops/sec** | 50K ops/sec | 557 ops/sec | 45K ops/sec |
| **Init Memory** | 266 KB | 167 KB | 205 KB | 1,316 KB |
| **Bundle (gzip)** | ~14 KB | ~8 KB | ~3 KB | ~15 KB |
| **Languages** | 4 (TR, EN, ES, DE) | 1 (EN) | 1 (EN) | 9 |
| **Zero Dependencies** | Yes | Yes | No | No |

> **What does this mean?** terlik.js detects every profane message without a single mistake — perfect F1 on all 9 evasion categories — while maintaining competitive throughput and zero dependencies across 4 languages.

## Libraries Tested

| Library | Version | How it works | Languages |
|---|---|---|---|
| [terlik.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/terlik.js) | local | Multi-layer normalization + regex pattern engine + suffix system | TR, EN, ES, DE |
| [bad-words](https://www.npmjs.com/package/bad-words) | 3.0.4 | Static word list with simple regex splitting | EN |
| [obscenity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/obscenity) | 0.4.6 | RegExp transformer pipeline with character substitutions | EN |
| [allprofanity](https://www.npmjs.com/package/allprofanity) | 2.2.1 | Aho-Corasick automaton + Bloom filter | 9 languages (no Turkish) |

**What's the difference?**
- **bad-words** checks if a word appears in a static list. Simple but brittle — "f.u.c.k" or "phuck" bypasses it.
- **obscenity** applies character transformations before matching. Better at leet speak, but can't handle separators.
- **allprofanity** uses Aho-Corasick (a fast multi-pattern search algorithm). Fast init, but limited evasion handling.
- **terlik.js** normalizes text through 6 stages (lowercase → char folding → leet decode → separator removal → repeat collapse → pattern match), then matches against regex patterns built from the dictionary. This catches evasion techniques the others miss.

## Dataset

290 labeled English samples across 9 categories. Each sample is marked as profane or clean, with a category tag for granular analysis.

| Category | Samples | Profane? | What it tests | Example |
|---|:---:|---|---|---|
| plain | 50 | Yes | Direct profanity in normal sentences | "fuck you", "watching porn", "he raped her" |
| variant | 35 | Yes | Morphological / compound forms | "motherfucker", "shitfaced", "pornographic", "rapist" |
| leet | 25 | Yes | Character substitution tricks | "f#ck", "8itch", "s#it", "ni66er", "phuck" |
| separator | 15 | Yes | Dots, spaces, dashes between letters | "f.u.c.k", "s h i t", "n.i.g.g.e.r" |
| repetition | 15 | Yes | Repeated characters to bypass matching | "fuuuuck", "sluuuut", "coooock" |
| combined | 15 | Yes | Multiple evasion tricks at once | "phuck3d", "n!66er", "5h!tty" |
| clean | 50 | No | Normal sentences (should not be flagged) | "the weather is beautiful", "happy birthday" |
| whitelist | 70 | No | Words containing profanity substrings | "assassin", "analysis", "grape", "therapist", "pussywillow" |
| edge_case | 15 | Mixed | Boundary conditions | Empty strings, ALL CAPS, unicode, very long text |
| | **290** | | | |

> **Why these categories?** Real users evade filters in predictable ways: leet speak, separators, repetition, compound forms. A library that only catches plain text profanity is trivial to bypass. This dataset tests the full evasion spectrum.

## Results

Measured on macOS, Node.js v24.4.0. Absolute numbers vary by hardware — relative ranking is what matters.

### 1. Overall Accuracy

> "How many mistakes does each library make?"

| Library | Precision | Recall | F1 | FPR | Accuracy | Total Errors |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **terlik.js** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** | **100.0%** | **0.0%** | **100.0%** | **0** |
| obscenity | 97.4% | 70.4% | 81.7% | 2.3% | 82.4% | 51 |
| bad-words | 100.0% | 49.4% | 66.1% | 0.0% | 71.7% | 82 |
| allprofanity | 100.0% | 42.6% | 59.7% | 0.0% | 67.9% | 93 |

**What do these metrics mean?**

| Metric | Plain English | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|
| **Precision** | "When it flags something, is it actually profane?" | Low precision = innocent messages get blocked. Users get frustrated. |
| **Recall** | "Does it catch all the profanity?" | Low recall = profanity slips through. The filter feels useless. |
| **F1** | Combined score (harmonic mean of Precision & Recall) | Single number to compare overall quality. 100% = perfect. |
| **FPR** | "How often does it wrongly flag clean text?" | Even 1% FPR means 1 in 100 clean messages gets blocked. |

**The bottom line:** terlik.js catches everything (100% recall) without any false alarms (100% precision). The next best library (obscenity) misses 30% of profanity and wrongly flags 2.3% of clean text.

### 2. Category Breakdown — Where Each Library Succeeds and Fails

> "What types of profanity does each library catch?"

| Category | terlik.js | bad-words | obscenity | allprofanity | What it means |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|---|
| **plain** | **50/50** | 43/50 | 42/50 | 37/50 | Basic profanity like "fuck you" |
| **variant** | **35/35** | 13/35 | 26/35 | 6/35 | Compound forms like "shitfaced" |
| **leet** | **25/25** | 13/25 | 20/25 | 14/25 | Character tricks like "8itch" |
| **separator** | **15/15** | 1/15 | 0/15 | 0/15 | Spaced out like "f.u.c.k" |
| **repetition** | **15/15** | 0/15 | 10/15 | 0/15 | Stretched like "fuuuuck" |
| **combined** | **15/15** | 4/15 | 10/15 | 6/15 | Multiple tricks at once |
| **clean** | **50/50** | 50/50 | 50/50 | 50/50 | Normal text (should pass) |
| **whitelist** | **70/70** | 70/70 | 67/70 | 70/70 | Tricky words (should pass) |
| **edge_case** | **15/15** | 14/15 | 14/15 | 14/15 | Boundary conditions |

The same data as percentages:

| Category | terlik.js | bad-words | obscenity | allprofanity |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| plain | **100%** | 86% | 84% | 74% |
| variant | **100%** | 37% | 74% | 17% |
| leet | **100%** | 52% | 80% | 56% |
| separator | **100%** | 7% | 0% | 0% |
| repetition | **100%** | 0% | 67% | 0% |
| combined | **100%** | 27% | 67% | 40% |
| clean | 100% | 100% | 100% | 100% |
| whitelist | **100%** | 100% | 96% | 100% |
| edge_case | **100%** | 93% | 93% | 93% |

### 3. Evasion Detection Deep Dive

> "Users actively try to bypass profanity filters. Which library survives?"

This is where the gap becomes dramatic. Evasion techniques are how real users bypass filters in chat, comments, and forums.

| Evasion technique | Example | terlik.js | bad-words | obscenity | allprofanity |
|---|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| Separator dots | `f.u.c.k` | Caught | Missed | Missed | Missed |
| Separator spaces | `s h i t` | Caught | Missed | Missed | Missed |
| Separator dashes | `a-s-s-h-o-l-e` | Caught | Missed | Missed | Missed |
| Separator underscores | `c_u_n_t` | Caught | Missed | Missed | Missed |
| Char repetition | `fuuuuck` | Caught | Missed | Caught | Missed |
| Char repetition | `sluuuut` | Caught | Missed | Caught | Missed |
| Leet: numbers | `sh1t`, `b1tch` | Caught | Caught | Caught | Caught |
| Leet: symbols | `$hit`, `a$$hole` | Caught | Caught | Caught | Caught |
| Leet: 8→b | `8itch` | Caught | Missed | Missed | Missed |
| Leet: 6→g | `ni66er` | Caught | Missed | Missed | Missed |
| Leet: #→h | `s#it` | Caught | Missed | Missed | Missed |
| Phonetic: ph→f | `phuck` | Caught | Missed | Missed | Missed |
| Combined | `phuck3d` | Caught | Missed | Missed | Missed |
| Combined | `n!66er` | Caught | Missed | Missed | Missed |
| Combined | `5h!tty` | Caught | Missed | Caught | Missed |

**Summary: evasion detection rate**

| | terlik.js | bad-words | obscenity | allprofanity |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **Evasion samples caught** | **70/70** | 18/70 | 40/70 | 20/70 |
| **Evasion detection rate** | **100%** | 26% | 57% | 29% |

> **What does this mean?** If a user types "phuck you" or "f.u.c.k off", only terlik.js will catch it. The other libraries miss 43-74% of evasion attempts.

---

### 4. False Positive Analysis

> "Does it incorrectly block innocent words?"

A filter that blocks "analysis" because it contains "anal", or "grape" because it contains "rape", is worse than no filter at all — it erodes user trust.

| Library | False Positives | Wrongly blocked words |
|---|:---:|---|
| **terlik.js** | **0** | None |
| bad-words | 0 | None |
| allprofanity | 0 | None |
| obscenity | 3 | "penistone" (a real English town), "pussywillow" (a plant), "pussycat" (a cat) |

**How does terlik.js avoid false positives with 56 roots?** A 96-entry whitelist explicitly protects words like:

| Tricky word | Contains | Why it's safe |
|---|---|---|
| analysis | anal | Academic term |
| therapist | rape | Medical profession |
| grape | rape | Fruit |
| hello | hell | Common greeting |
| title | tit | Document element |
| pussywillow | pussy | Plant species |
| screwdriver | screw | Tool |
| cocktail | cock | Beverage |
| penistone | penis | English town name |
| assassin | ass | Historical term |
| cucumber | cum | Vegetable |

All 70 whitelist trap sentences in the dataset pass correctly.

---

### 5. Error Breakdown by Library

> "What exactly does each library get wrong?"

#### terlik.js — 0 errors

Perfect score. Zero false positives, zero false negatives.

#### bad-words — 82 errors (0 FP, 82 FN)

| Error type | Count | Examples of missed profanity |
|---|:---:|---|
| Missed plain profanity | 7 | "that is bullshit", "they had an orgy", "dirty negro" |
| Missed variant forms | 22 | "shitfaced", "pornographic", "unfucking", "rapist", "cumshot" |
| Missed leet speak | 12 | "8itch", "s#it", "ni66er", "phuck", "c0ck" |
| Missed separators | 14 | All separator samples except 1 |
| Missed repetition | 15 | All repetition samples |
| Missed combined | 11 | Most combined evasion samples |
| Missed edge cases | 1 | Mixed case edge case |

> bad-words uses a simple word list. It can't handle any form of evasion — not leet speak, not separators, not repetition. Over half of all profane messages slip through.

#### obscenity — 51 errors (3 FP, 48 FN)

| Error type | Count | Examples |
|---|:---:|---|
| **False positives** | **3** | "penistone", "pussywillow", "pussycat" |
| Missed plain profanity | 8 | "what the hell", "damn it", "screw you", "this is crap" |
| Missed variant forms | 9 | "unfucking", "fuckery", "screwed", "hookers" |
| Missed leet speak | 5 | "8itch", "s#it", "ni66er", "phuck" |
| Missed separators | 15 | All separator samples (0% detection) |
| Missed repetition | 5 | Some repetition samples |
| Missed combined | 5 | Some combined evasion samples |
| Missed edge cases | 1 | Mixed case edge case |

> obscenity is the strongest competitor. It handles some leet speak and repetition via transformer pipeline, but has no separator detection at all and generates false positives due to lack of whitelist.

#### allprofanity — 93 errors (0 FP, 93 FN)

| Error type | Count | Examples |
|---|:---:|---|
| Missed plain profanity | 13 | "what the hell", "you prick", "screw you", "dirty negro" |
| Missed variant forms | 29 | Almost all variant forms (only 17% caught) |
| Missed leet speak | 11 | "8itch", "s#it", "ni66er", "phuck", many others |
| Missed separators | 15 | All separator samples (0% detection) |
| Missed repetition | 15 | All repetition samples (0% detection) |
| Missed combined | 9 | Most combined evasion samples |
| Missed edge cases | 1 | Mixed case edge case |

> allprofanity's Aho-Corasick engine is fast but rigid. It matches exact strings from its word list and can't handle any morphological or evasion variation.

---

### 6. Throughput

> "How fast can each library process messages?"

Measured in operations per second (higher = better). Each operation processes a batch of 100 messages.

**Detection speed (check/containsProfanity):**

| Library | ops/sec | avg latency | p50 | p95 | p99 | vs terlik.js |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| obscenity | 71,914 | 1,390 μs | 1,354 μs | 1,572 μs | 1,687 μs | ~1.06x faster |
| **terlik.js** | **67,623** | **1,478 μs** | **1,481 μs** | **1,672 μs** | **1,863 μs** | — |
| allprofanity | 45,450 | 2,200 μs | 2,173 μs | 2,465 μs | 2,649 μs | 1.5x slower |
| bad-words | 2,831 | 35,310 μs | 36,141 μs | 38,131 μs | 39,846 μs | 24x slower |

**Cleaning speed (clean/censor):**

| Library | ops/sec | avg latency | p50 | p95 | p99 | vs terlik.js |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| **terlik.js** | **71,321** | **1,401 μs** | **1,342 μs** | **1,761 μs** | **2,000 μs** | — |
| obscenity | 49,978 | 2,001 μs | 1,989 μs | 2,255 μs | 2,449 μs | 1.4x slower |
| allprofanity | 45,162 | 2,214 μs | 2,215 μs | 2,479 μs | 2,658 μs | 1.6x slower |
| bad-words | 557 | 179,578 μs | 184,372 μs | 191,515 μs | 194,643 μs | 128x slower |

> **What do these numbers mean in practice?** At 68K ops/sec, terlik.js can check ~68,000 messages per second on a single core. For a chat app with 1,000 concurrent users sending 1 message/second, that's 68x headroom. obscenity edges ahead on raw check() by ~6%, but terlik.js is **43% faster on clean()** and catches 30% more profanity (100% vs 70% recall). bad-words would need 24 cores for the same load.

**p95/p99 explained:** p95 = 95% of batches complete within this time. p99 = 99%. Low p99 means consistent performance without random spikes.

#### Where Does the Throughput Go?

terlik.js runs a multi-pass detection pipeline that trades raw speed for detection depth. Here's what each layer costs and what it catches:

| Detection Layer | Throughput Cost | What It Catches | Can You Disable It? |
|---|---|---|---|
| NFKD decomposition | ~3% | Fullwidth evasion (ｆｕｃｋ), accented tricks (fück) | No — safety layer |
| Cyrillic confusable mapping | ~1% | Cyrillic а→a, о→o substitution | No — safety layer |
| Combining mark stripping | ~1% | Diacritics used for evasion (s̈h̊ït) | No — safety layer |
| Locale-aware lowercase | ~1% | İ→i, I→ı (Turkish locale correctness) | No — safety layer |
| Leet decode + number expansion | ~5% | $1kt1r, f#ck, 8itch, s2k | Yes: `disableLeetDecode: true` |
| CamelCase decompounding | ~3% | ShitLord, FuckYou (non-variant compounds) | Yes: `disableCompound: true` |
| Suffix chain matching | ~3% | Suffixed forms (siktirci, fuckers) | No — core detection |

> **Do NOT disable safety layers for performance.** The ~6% total cost of NFKD + Cyrillic + diacritics + locale lowercase is non-negotiable — without them, trivial Unicode tricks bypass the entire filter. These layers run on every input regardless of toggle settings.

#### When to Use the Optional Toggles

| Toggle | Use Case | Performance Gain | Risk |
|---|---|---|---|
| `disableLeetDecode: true` | Input is from a controlled source (e.g., CMS with restricted charset, database field names) | ~5% faster | Misses $1kt1r, 8itch, f#ck, number-embedded evasions |
| `disableCompound: true` | Camel case is intentional (e.g., code identifiers like `ShittyClassName`) | ~3% faster | Misses novel compounds not in dictionary (ShitLord, FuckBoy if not variant) |
| `minSeverity: "medium"` | Skip mild words (damn, crap, hell) in casual contexts | Marginal (pattern-level skip) | Low-severity profanity passes through |
| `excludeCategories: ["sexual"]` | Allow general/insult words but block sexual content | Marginal (pattern-level skip) | Selected category passes through |

**Important:** `disableLeetDecode` does NOT disable all substitution detection. The regex charClass patterns (Pass 1) still catch some visual substitutions like `$` → `s`. The toggle only disables the normalizer's decode stages (leet map + number expansion). If a user says "I set `disableLeetDecode` but `$hit` is still caught" — that's by design. The charClass patterns are part of the core regex engine, not the normalizer.

### 7. Memory Usage

> "How much RAM does each library consume?"

Heap and RSS delta measured in KB:

| Library | Init Heap | Init RSS | After 2K msgs Heap | After 2K msgs RSS | Notes |
|---|---:|---:|---:|---:|---|
| terlik.js | +266 KB | +44 KB | -2,966 KB | +1,352 KB | GC reclaims memory efficiently |
| obscenity | +167 KB | +24 KB | +713 KB | +28 KB | Lightweight, stable |
| bad-words | +205 KB | +12 KB | +9,552 KB | +40 KB | Heap grows with usage |
| allprofanity | +1,316 KB | +272 KB | -5,984 KB | -20,444 KB | Large init (loads 2 dictionaries) |

**What does this mean?**
- **Init Heap:** Memory used just to load the library. All are lightweight (~170-220 KB) except allprofanity (1.3 MB, loads English + Hindi dictionaries by default).
- **After processing:** terlik.js and allprofanity show negative heap deltas — V8's garbage collector reclaims memory after JIT optimization. bad-words accumulates ~9.5 MB after processing 2,000 messages.
- Run with `node --expose-gc` for precise measurements.

### 8. Bundle Size

> "How much does this add to my application?"

| Library | Raw size | Gzipped | Dependencies |
|---|---:|---:|---|
| terlik.js | ~67 KB | **~14 KB** | 0 |
| obscenity | ~45 KB | ~8 KB | 0 |
| bad-words | ~15 KB | ~3 KB | 1 (badwords-list) |
| allprofanity | ~80 KB | ~15 KB | 2 |

**Dictionary expansion + strictness toggles impact (v2.4.1 → current):**

| | v2.4.1 | Current | Delta |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| English roots | 36 | 56 | +20 |
| Explicit variants | 139 | 185 | +46 |
| Whitelist entries | 60 | 96 | +36 |
| Suffix rules | 8 | 9 | +1 |
| ESM raw | ~57 KB | ~67 KB | +10 KB |
| ESM gzip | ~12 KB | ~14 KB | **+2 KB** |

> The English detection overhaul (20 new roots, 46 variants, 36 whitelist entries) plus Phase 1-4 features (NFKD normalization, CamelCase decompounding, Cyrillic confusable handling, strictness toggles) added only **+2 KB gzipped**.

### 9. The Trade-off Map

> "Every library makes trade-offs. Here's where each one sits."

| | High Precision | High Recall | Fast | Small | Evasion-proof |
|---|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|:---:|
| **terlik.js** | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes | Yes |
| obscenity | Mostly | No | Yes | Yes | Partially |
| bad-words | Yes | No | No | Yes | No |
| allprofanity | Yes | No | Mostly | Mostly | No |

**In plain English:**
- **terlik.js** — Perfect detection, competitive speed, zero dependencies. The only library that handles all evasion types. Slightly slower on check() than obscenity (~6%) due to multi-pass detection, but 43% faster on clean().
- **obscenity** — Good precision, decent leet handling, marginally fastest check(). Can't handle separators and has no whitelist (causes false positives). Closest competitor on speed, distant on accuracy.
- **bad-words** — Zero false positives, but misses over half of all profanity. Any determined user will bypass it. 24x slower than terlik.js.
- **allprofanity** — Similar to bad-words but with more language support. Weak evasion handling. Fast init but large memory footprint.

---

## How terlik.js Achieves This

The detection pipeline explains why terlik.js catches what others miss:

```
Input: "phuck y0u m0th3rfuck3r"
  │
  ├─ Pass 0: 10-stage normalizer
  │   ├─ 1. Strip invisible chars (ZWSP, soft hyphen, etc.)
  │   ├─ 2. NFKD decompose (ｆｕｃｋ → fuck, accented → base)
  │   ├─ 3. Strip combining marks (diacritics)
  │   ├─ 4. Locale-aware lowercase
  │   ├─ 5. Cyrillic confusable → Latin (Cyrillic а→a, о→o, etc.)
  │   ├─ 6. Char folding (ü→u, ö→o, etc.)
  │   ├─ 7. Number expansion (s2k → sikik in TR)
  │   ├─ 8. Leet decode (0→o, 3→e, $→s)
  │   ├─ 9. Punctuation removal (f.u.c.k → fuck)
  │   └─ 10. Repeat collapse (fuuuck → fuck)
  │   Result: "phuck you motherfucker"
  │
  ├─ Pass 1: Locale-lowered regex matching
  │   charClasses: f=[fph], so "ph" → matches "f" pattern
  │   "phuck" matches /[fph][uv][c][k]/ → ✅ fuck
  │
  ├─ Pass 2: Normalized text regex matching
  │   "motherfucker" → ✅ direct variant match
  │
  ├─ Pass 3: CamelCase decompounding (ShitLord → Shit Lord)
  │
  ├─ Whitelist check → neither word is whitelisted
  └─ Result: 2 matches found
```

Other libraries fail at different stages:
- **bad-words** has no leet decode, no separator removal, no pattern matching
- **obscenity** has leet decode + some patterns, but no separator removal and no phonetic matching (ph→f)
- **allprofanity** has basic matching but no normalization pipeline

## Transparency: Where terlik.js Can Still Improve

100% on 290 samples doesn't mean perfection in the wild. Known limitations:

| Limitation | Example | Status |
|---|---|---|
| Context-dependent words | "hell yeah" is flagged (but user may consider it mild) | By design — severity: "low" |
| 3-letter root FP risk | "cum" in "cucumber" | Protected by whitelist, but new compounds may appear |
| Rapidly evolving slang | New coinages not in dictionary | Use `addWords()` or `customList` at runtime |
| Non-Latin scripts | Cyrillic "а" substituted for Latin "a" | Handled (Cyrillic confusable → Latin mapping) |
| Dataset size | 290 samples is comprehensive but not exhaustive | Continuously expanding |

We document every limitation and encourage the community to report edge cases.

---

## Methodology

| Parameter | Value |
|---|---|
| Warmup iterations | 100 (V8 JIT compilation) |
| Measurement iterations | 1,000 |
| Batch size | 100 messages per iteration |
| Latency metric | Per-batch microsecond timing |
| Percentiles | p50, p95, p99 |
| Memory measurement | `process.memoryUsage()` delta |
| Isolation | Each library in independent adapter |
| Fairness | Same corpus, same machine, same process |

### Adapter Pattern

Each library is wrapped in a `LibraryAdapter` interface with `init()`, `check()`, and `clean()` methods:

| Library | check() API | clean() API |
|---|---|---|
| terlik.js | `containsProfanity()` | `clean()` |
| bad-words | `isProfane()` / `clean() !== text` | `clean()` |
| obscenity | `matcher.hasMatch()` | `censor.applyTo()` |
| allprofanity | `check()` | `clean()` |

Adapters: [`benchmarks/comparison/adapters.ts`](../benchmarks/comparison/adapters.ts)

### Limitations of This Benchmark

| Limitation | Impact |
|---|---|
| **English only** | Doesn't test TR/ES/DE — only the common denominator |
| **290 samples** | Comprehensive but not exhaustive. Real-world text is more varied |
| **Self-reported** | Maintained by terlik.js team. We aim for fairness but acknowledge potential bias |
| **Single machine** | Absolute ops/sec numbers depend on hardware. Relative ranking matters more |
| **Default configs** | All libraries tested with default settings. Custom tuning may improve results |
| **bad-words v3** | Tested v3.0.4 (latest on npm). A v4 may exist but npm resolves to v3 |

## Run It Yourself

**Prerequisites:** Node.js >= 18, pnpm

```bash
# From the repository root:
pnpm build                  # Build terlik.js first
pnpm bench:compare          # Install deps + run benchmark

# Or manually:
cd benchmarks/comparison
pnpm install
npx tsx run.ts              # Standard run
node --expose-gc --import tsx/esm run.ts   # With accurate memory
```

**Output:**
1. Formatted tables to the console
2. JSON results to `benchmarks/comparison/results/comparison-results.json`

### Modifying the Benchmark

| Task | How |
|---|---|
| Add test cases | Edit `dataset.ts` — add `{ text, profane, category }` |
| Add a library | Create adapter in `adapters.ts`, add factory to `run.ts` |
| Change iterations | Edit `WARMUP_ITERATIONS` / `MEASURE_ITERATIONS` in `throughput.ts` |
